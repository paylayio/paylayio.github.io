IdentityServer
==============

An OpenID Connect provider plays a **central part** in the PAYLAY ecosystem. All PAYLAY apps require this for authentication and authorization.

PAYLAY provides a simple OpenID Connect provider called *IdentityServer* to bootstrap the development process on your local developer machine.

For production purposes, we recommend you using your existing OpenID Connect provider solution.
