PAYLAY
======
PAYLAY is a Payments Framework solution for easily developing and integrating eCommerce processes into your organisation's platform:
- connect to Leading Payment Service Providers
- connect to Messaging Systems
- connect to leading Database Providers

PAYLAY is striving to be technology-agnostic so that you can continue using your favorite development tools and deploy to any environment you prefer or already have.

## Ecosystem
The PAYLAY ecosystem consists of 3 core applications:
- [PaymentServer](paymentserver/readme.md) lets you connect to leading Payment Service Providers by exposing a REST API with a simplified structure.
- [IdentityServer](identityserver/readme.md) is an OpenID and OAuth2 provider that is required for protecting access to the PaymentServer resources.
- [Dashboard](dashboard/readme.md) is a front-end application that offers you tools to manage the PaymentServer and view real-time payment insights.
